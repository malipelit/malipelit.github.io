# Personal Website

## About Me
Hi folks,

I am Mehmet, a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo. I created (and continue to work on) this website to showcase my resume in more detail. You can find detailed information about my career and education history on my [website](https://malipelit.github.io/ "Click to go to website")!

While making this website, I had a lot of fun and learned so much. I hope you enjoy the page as much as I do!

Mehmet
